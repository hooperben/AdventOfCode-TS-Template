## Advent of Code Solutions Template (Typescript)

## Installation

To get things installed - from root run:

```
yarn install
```

or whatever package manager you prefer (bun would be fastest?)

## To Generate a new day's template - run:

```
// if it's the current days challenge:
yarn newDay

// if it's a non today day you're passing im:
yarn customNewDay

// and follow the prompts
```

This will create:

- day/<day>/1.ts: the file for the first challenge
- day/<day>/2.ts: the file for the second challenge
- day/<day>/input.txt: the input file for the day (where you copy paste from the website)
- day/<day>/README.md: optional, but putting the solutions in a README.md just looks neat I guess
